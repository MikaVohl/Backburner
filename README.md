# Backburner
Backburner is an iOS recipe manager app that allows you to access all your recipes from any source in one convenient place. Backburner uses an open-source [recipe scraping library](https://github.com/hhursev/recipe-scrapers) to fetch raw recipe data from any website so it can be formatted however the user chooses. These recipes are stored locally to allow offline-access and easy exporting.

Backburner is built with XCode and written in the Swift programming language
